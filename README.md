## Installation - NPM

```sh
Open terminal in the same location as the Nexio-api-SDK folder.

Open VScode at this location by typing 'code .'

In VsCode Terminal, enter npm i to get the dependencies which will create the node modules folder.

The sdk is present in the dist folder but in case you need to make changes in Nexio.ts and rebuild it, use the following Commands 

npm run build 

npm run rollup

Once done, all you need to do is run the example.html on a live server. (Install VSCode extension for Live server, if already not installed).

```

## Installation - Browser


```html
<script src=""></script>
```
# Nexio-api-SDK
